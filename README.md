# instaclone-backend
A simple Instagram like backend in NodeJs from Rocketseat OmniStack course


## How to run
To run this project you need to have NodeJS installed.

Clone it with:

`git clone git@github.com:mathvp/instaclone-backend.git`  
`cd instaclone-backend`

Before run, you need to setup the Database URL for the Mongoose, in the .env file.  
There is a .env_sample file to help you with this.  
IÂ´m using a free instance of [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).


Run with:

`node src/index.js`
